# Brain Rush

## Description

Brain Rush is a game developed to collect ErrP (error-related potentials) signals when using an EEG headset. The game is programmed to react randomly to players’ commands at some intervals of time, while the EEG headset captures the ErrP signals produced when the reaction is different from the one the player was expecting. This data will be used to study classification techniques of ErrP and later on applied to develop a software that can learn to adapt itself to the users will without receiving any external command, only the EEG signals from the headset.

The 2d game takes place in a cemetery, where a zombie must eat as many brains as he can in the stipulated time. The player who reaches a higher quantity of brains gets the highest score.
This experiment is the next part of a preview research, which drilldown report is available [here](https://github.com/marco7m/brain-rush/blob/master/relatorio.pdf)
